## Goals

Countries signing up to the [Open Contracting Global Principles](http://www.open-contracting.org/global_principles) commit to Affirmative Disclosure of "information related to the formation, award, execution, performance, and completion of public contracts" including data on all stages of contracting, from pre-bid to performance evaluations, and information on subcontracting arrangements. They commit to developing systems that make information accessible in the Open Contracting Data Standard.

Doing this should support the **Participation, Monitoring, and Oversight** elements of the Open Contracting Global Principles "supporting all relevant stakeholders to understand, monitor and improve public contracting". 

This use case describes governments goals of using a data standard as part of their compliance with the Open Contracting Global Principles. 

## The current situation

Governments keep contracting information in many different systems. Data is often not joined up between different phases of the contracting process, and some parts of the process may be on paper, whilst others are digitised. Some tenders and awards may be disclosed as-per the terms of International Trade Agreements, but only over a particular $ value. Framework contracts, public private partnerships and other kinds of contracts may all be dealt with differently.

Pre-tender information, and performance information, is very rarely published in any structured form in existing systems - and few systems link payment details to contract information.

The Open Contracting Global Principles call for all the following sorts of information:


1. Contracts, including licenses, concessions, permits, grants or any other document exchanging public goods,  assets, or resources (including all annexes, schedules and documents incorporated by reference) and any amendments thereto;
2. Related pre-studies, bid documents, performance evaluations, guarantees, and auditing reports.  
3. Information concerning contract formation, including: 
  * The planning process of the procurement;
  * The method of procurement or award and the justification thereof;
  * The scope and specifications for each contract;
  * The criteria for evaluation and selection;
  * The bidders or participants in the process, their validation documents, and any procedural exemptions for which they qualify;
  * Any conflicts of interest uncovered or debarments issued;
  * The results of the evaluation, including the justification for the award; and
  * The identity of the contract recipient and any statements of beneficial ownership provided;
4.  Information related to performance and completion of public contracts, including information regarding subcontracting arrangements, such as:
  * General schedules, including major milestones in execution, and any changes thereto;
  * Status of implementation against milestones;
  * Dates and amounts of stage payments made or received (against total amount) and the source of those payments;
  * Service delivery and pricing;
  * Arrangements for ending contracts;
  * Final settlements and responsibilities;
  * Risk assessments, including environmental and social impact assessments;
  * Assessments of assets and liabilities of government related to the contract;
  * Provisions in place to ensure appropriate management of ongoing risks and liabilities; and
  * Appropriate financial information regarding revenues and expenditures, such as time and cost overruns, if any.

## User stories

* As an signatory to the Open Contracting Global Principles I would like a defined standard so that I can meet my obligations to publish key contract information;

* As a signatory to the Open Contracting Global Principles I would like a set of tools and approaches so that I can connect up data from different stages of the contracting process;

* As a national government signatory to the Open Contracting Global Principles I would like a dashboard that can show me which departments, agencies and local authorities are complying the the disclosure requirements of the principles so that I can report on how well we are progressing to apply them right across the country;

* As a citizen of a country that has signed the Open Contracting Global Principles I would like to be able to see at a glance how often the government is publishing details about _all_ stages of the contracting process so that I can check whether they are complying with the principles or not;

* As a civil society organisation in a country that as signed the Open Contracting Global Principles I would like to be able to review how many high-value contracts did include elements of public participation so that I can compare whether levels of participation in the health sector where I work are higher or lower than in other sectors;

* As a watchdog organisation in a country that has signed the Open Contracting Global Principles I would like to be able to give my judgement on whether particular contracting processes involved adequate citizen participation so that there is pressure upon government to improve the levels of participation;

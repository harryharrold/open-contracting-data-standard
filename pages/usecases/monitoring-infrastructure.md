## Goals

An elected officials of a municipal authority is responsible for oversight of public budgets and spending. The city currently budgets on a three-yearly cycle for works, but projects may take many years from budget to completion. A road refurbishment project is taking place. The elected official wants to ensure that the authority is getting value for money for the project, that the work is completed to a high quality, and that no funds are lost through corruption. 

## The situation now

A budget is set for the project, and tenders issued. A contractor is selected on the basis of the lowest bid. The project begins, but no realised budgets are available until 14-months after the end of the financial year, and these are not directly linked to contracts. During implementation it is discovered that the original tender made an error in stating the length of road to be laid, and so an amendment is made to the contract to cover an extra 10-miles. Payments against the contract are made over a number of years, with the total substantially exceeding the original budget, although the reasons for the over-run are not clearly documented. Payments may be delayed many months after work is completed, with large firms able to accept six-month and longer delays in payment, but small firms forced into bankruptcy by these delays. 

Later on, revenue budgets for repairing the road are not linked to the original capital expenditure. Sometimes repairs take place through the capital budget when city engineers are paid as contractors at the year-end. 

The road built through this contract breaks up much quicker than other roads by the same contractor, due to the low quality of work by a particular subcontractor who worked on the project.

## User stories

* As an elected official I want to be able to monitor the progress of a contract throughout itâ€™s implementation, able to check in on how far budget has been realised at each stage of the contract;

* As an elected official I want to see the linkage between a contract and the specific infrastructure it has funded, and for that link to be maintained into the future;

* As an elected official I want to understand which part of the public authority is responsible for implementing and monitoring a contract;

* As an elected official I want to be able to compare bids based on the cost and quantity of inputs to be used (e.g. Asphalt; Crushed Stone), rather than always opting for lowest-cost bids;

* As an elected official I want to be able to compare the cost of inputs and work in my local area to the cost of inputs and work in other areas;

* As an elected official, if I can see information on the tender, and final realisation, of a contract, I can know where to investigate for more information - but if I only know about one end of the process (start or end) it is hard to know where to look.

## Related requirements: 

* **Lifetime tracking**- ID that connects budget, contract and cheque-book entries

* **Line Items** - It should be possible to record line-items required by the contract, including using a controlled list of kinds of contract 

* **Geographic Information System Linkage** - It should be possible to relate particular elements of a contract to entries in a Geographic Information System (either the internal authority system, or a public system such as Open Street Map

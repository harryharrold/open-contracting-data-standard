## Goals

Users want to visualise contracting data.

## The current situation

The data is not shaped in ways that enable easy visualisation. When visualisations do get made they are not easy to discover. They often make mistakes.

## User stories

Provide a series of bullet point statments from the persepctive of the user of the form:

* I want to be able to visualise the total rate of spend over time 
* I want to know what people are doing with this data
* I want to understand good practices for visualising this data. 

## Requirements

_Based on the user stories, identify key requirements that data will need to meet for this user to be satisfied. Add a bulletted list._

This is where we keep links to notes from meetings, presentations, etc. that are going on.
If you think we've missed something, please [contact us](/pages/community.html).

We also have a [hackpad space](https://opencontractingdata.hackpad.com/) where we take live notes. We will try to
also document and record things here.

On Jan 31, 2014 we held a Stakeholder Workshop in Montreal. We were lucky enough to
be able to time this with the [IATI TAG](http://www.aidtransparency.net/governance/tag/tag-meeting-january-2014) 
meeting and the [Open Data for Development Challenge](http://www.open-dev-ouvert.ca/)

[Workshop agenda](https://opencontractingdata.hackpad.com/Jan-2014-Stakeholder-Workshop-agenda-and-details-6SdRSSMc9SR)

A number of hackpads were used to record notes throughout the day, these can be found [here](https://opencontractingdata.hackpad.com/ep/group/yRyVQVeVKTf)

During the morning, we split into groups and brainstormed potential users on post-it notes. These post-it notes
were then re-captured [here](https://trello.com/b/djs9IEiK/potential-users-montreal-workshop)

A few of these users were then taken and developed into fledged out [personas](personas.html).

In addition, during the break out sessions, in the afternoon, different people started talking & brainstorming about areas that interested
them. Some notes were capture on the [hackpads](https://opencontractingdata.hackpad.com/ep/group/yRyVQVeVKTf) 
and some on giant flip charts. The following notes were transcribed from the hackpads:

* [Governance](governance.html)
* [Identifiers](identifiers.html)
* [Map of actors](map_of_actors.html)

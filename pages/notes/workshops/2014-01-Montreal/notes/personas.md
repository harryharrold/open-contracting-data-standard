## Background

At the first Open Contracting Stakeholder Workshop in Montreal (January 31st 2014) we used a set of [persona profile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(user_experience)) and idea-generation activities to imagine the kinds of people who might be able to use Open Contracting information, and to consider what needs they may have for an Open Contracting Data Standard. 

* **Personal profiles** help us to consider the constraints that potential users of Open Contracting data may be 


### Ran Tameng, Marketing Manager

Ran Tameng is a marketing manager and contractor in Nepal. He is 33 years old. He runs a 50 person company building roads. He is seeking new business by reading tenders, driving around, and reading the papers. He uses a mobile phone and is well networked. He is highly competitive, and very busy. He has an assistant to help him out because he is always short of time. 

#### Contracting information needs

* Fast and real-time access to know if contracts are lost or won
 * And who won, at what rate, for what services
  * To find out about subcontracting opportunities
* Documents and technical specifications
* Locations and timelines
* Contracting office responsible for a contract
* Historical information to analyse the trend for who is investing in roads
* Who is running the project
* Procurement conditions

#### Use case ideas

#### Use case ideas

* Forward looking data (government plans, tender notes)
* Tender notes, numbers - what / how much goes to what company 
* Contract demands
* Financial data terminal / data stream e.g. Reuters & Bloomberg
* Would be interested in having access to data
* To see the competition around
* Contract management - who is paid what?
* How many companies bid? What are the margins?
* To see all bidding behavior
* Challenge: no one wants to give Andrew that data

Tools he needs:
* Integrated API linked to local stock ticket & data stream
* Interested in an Investment Planners Index

### Claire Smith, Founder of Design & Communications SME

Claire is 45, she started her own company 10 years ago after having children. She is based in Montreal. She's very on top of trends in web & design. She is used to dealing with the private sector - she enjoys the dynamism.  She believes the bids are pre-determined. She has no trust in the system. She is not sure if government contracting is a good opportunity for her business or not.

#### Contracting information needs

* Sector information on countries without a lot of time to gather them because she works a lot with reports, proposals and high-level project finance

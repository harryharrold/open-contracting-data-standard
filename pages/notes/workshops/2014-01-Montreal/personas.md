At the first Open Contracting Stakeholder Workshop in Montreal (January 31st 2014) we used a set of [persona profile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(user_experience\)) and idea-generation activities to imagine the kinds of people who might be able to use Open Contracting information, and to consider what needs they may have for an Open Contracting Data Standard. 

Personal profiles help us to consider the constraints that potential users of Open Contracting data may experience.

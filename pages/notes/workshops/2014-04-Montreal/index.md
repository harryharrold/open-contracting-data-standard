Venue: Palais des congrès de Montréal - [https://us.pycon.org/2014/venue/](https://us.pycon.org/2014/venue/) (Montreal, Canada)

## Background
Public contracting information (what governments buy) is often unavailable for scrutiny. The Open Contracting Partnership is promoting disclosure and participation in public contracting. At the moment, many public bodies are publishing their contract data, or parts of their data. But that data is often incompatible with other similar data, locked away in a custom system/interface. And then there are many bodies who do not publish any data at all. In 2014, we are aiming to release a first version of a draft standard.

## Sprint
As part of PyCon 2014, we will be doing 4 days of "sprinting" on the Open Contracting project. Anyone is welcome to come for a few hours or for all four days. 

Perhaps you have your own OpenContracting project you'd like to work on, or we have a lot of suggestions of things we'd love help with - we are tracking all ideas in the hackpad embedded below. Please add / comment freely.

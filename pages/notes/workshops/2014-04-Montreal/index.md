## Background
Public contracting information (what governments buy) is often unavailable for scrutiny. The Open Contracting Partnership is promoting disclosure and participation in public contracting. At the moment, many public bodies are publishing their contract data, or parts of their data. But that data is often incompatible with other similar data, locked away in a custom system/interface. And then there are many bodies who do not publish any data at all. In 2014, we are aiming to release a first version of a draft standard.

To help scope the dataset review, I've made three rough "types of review" to 
give an understanding of what to get done in a given amount of time:

* poke (1 hour)
* tickle (0.5 day)
* hug (1 day)

### Poke (1 hour)
Basically find the dataset, check its real, poke it a bit and write up the basics

* Find the website / websites where it lives
* See how the site works - can you download the data? is there documentation? is the data across
multiple tables? is there a common identifier across the tables? etc.
* Document this (name, publisher, urls etc.) on [open data comparison](http://ocds.stage.aptivate.org/opendatacomparison/) 

### Tickle (0.5 days)
Poke + Try and work with the dataset. 

* Read the documentation
* Download the data
* Understand how it joins up
* Is there more on the site than is downloadable? 
* Are categories being used? Where do they come from?
* What identifiers are there for the different entities?
* How does this dataset deal with entities, transactions, etc?
* What parts of the contracting phase does this data cover? Are other phases of
the contracting process covered somewhere else - maybe even on another site?
* Document (where??)

### Hug (1 day)
Poke + Tickle + Document the data

* Document the fields and the field types (field comparator coming - what about
qualitative)
* Document how to link between datasets. Test this actually works e.g. take the
bid data and award data and the field you expect to be able to link them and see how many 
links you actually get. (where??)
* Document sources for categorization, or generate a list from the datasets of
the categorizations found. (i.e. get all unique values for that column)
* Map fields to open contracting data standard (how?)
* Future: Document whether we have all fields for a bridge or open-corporates match

There are already a lot of agencies publishing public contracting data. As a 
result its vital that we both learn from these existing sets and ensure that 
we can accomodate them.

We are reviewing as many as we can as part of our "supply side" analysis of 
open contracting data.

There are three types of possible review, which are documented [here](review_types.html)

The prioritized list of datasets for review including which type of review are [here](priorities.html)

The progress against this list is in this [hackpad](https://opencontractingdata.hackpad.com/Dataset-Review-progress-CtdgQB5aLrA) (needs organizing)

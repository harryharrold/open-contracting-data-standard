## Background

At the first Open Contracting Stakeholder Workshop in Montreal (January 31st 2014) we used a set of [persona profile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(user_experience)) and idea-generation activities to imagine the kinds of people who might be able to use Open Contracting information, and to consider what needs they may have for an Open Contracting Data Standard. 

* **Personal profiles** help us to consider the constraints that potential users of Open Contracting data may be 


### Ran Tameng, Marketing Manager

Ran Tameng is a marketing manager and contractor in Nepal. He is 33 years old. He runs a 50 person company building roads. He is seeking new business by reading tenders, driving around, and reading the papers. He uses a mobile phone and is well networked. He is highly competitive, and very busy. He has an assistant to help him out because he is always short of time. 

His contracting information needs include:

* Fast and real-time access to know if contracts are lost or won
** And who won, at what rate, for what services
*** To find out about subcontracting opportunities
* Documents and technical specifications
* Locations and timelines
* Contracting office responsible for a contract
* Historical information to analyse the trend for who is investing in roads
* Who is running the project
* Procurement conditions

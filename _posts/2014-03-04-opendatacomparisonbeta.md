[Update: Links for site changed as stage is no longer accessible]


I've hacked together a BETA version for storing and comparing information on open contracting data sets.  You can see it here: [http://ocds.aptivate.org/opendatacomparison](http://ocds.aptivate.org/opendatacomparison).

The purpose of the site is for us to start collecting information about the slew of open contracting data that's already out there. It's not a data store, its a meta-data store if that makes sense.

There's a lot of datasets to process so if you're interested in helping add content that would be really great. Please ping me to get an account, I haven't got round to a sign-up page yet.

There are still lots of pieces to add so please do ask if you'd like to see something that isn't there.

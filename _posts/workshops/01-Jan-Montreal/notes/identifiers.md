### Transactions
1. How are they identified in systems (do they have unique ids?)
1. What is a transaction?
* money (w/amount)
* what type?
* description
* classifications?
* source
* target
* part of an activity
 * derive an identifier from here for the transaction?
 * other related identifiers? e.g. bank ledger entry 

### Organizations

1. What is an organization?
 * Some non-natural person/body/institution
 * Often (not always) a legal activity
 * Often (not always) registered with 1 or more national registration bodies
 * Can lead to 1 or more identifiers being assigned
 * May be part of or contain other organizations
 * May be owned / controlled by one of more people
 * May have one or more physical addresses
 * At least one person associated with it
 * Has some descriptive classifying attributes
 * Does stuff at various locations
 * May have, receive and spend $
 * May have a bank account and various regulatory documents (tax return etc)
1. How to identify an organization
 * Country of operations / base (of counding person, HQ, PO BOX, etc)
 * Registration body (Companies register, tax office, stock no. etc)
 * Bank account
 * URL
 * Coordinates / box
 * Name (not in canada)
 * People connected
 * Sort of stuff they do (sectors)
 * 3rd party / other peoples' lists
1. Problems
 * not public data
 * no number
 * harm (may not want to identify)
1. Conclusions
 * Lots of organizations might not have globally unique IDS (does this matter -> government etc. will only do business with them if they're a legal entity)
 * Start with national registration bodies
 * Orgs may change over time - split, merge, use/share other's names

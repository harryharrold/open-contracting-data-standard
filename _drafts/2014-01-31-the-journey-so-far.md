We started the first Open Contracting Data Standard workshop in Montreal today by exploring the Open Contracting, and data standardisation journey so far.

No decisions on the exact form of that standard are made yet - and the real test of it's success will be in how far it can be used and implemented, but we're not starting entirely from scratch.
